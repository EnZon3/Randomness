# Randomness
 Random programs I'm making.
NOTE: most of these are works in progress.
Also note: If I make and finish a program that is also practical, I might move it to its own repository.
As for the OS I'm making.. I did not type all of the code. (I typed most of it.) The files with comments on almost every line were made by another guy. (I don't know his name) You can find the copy-pasted code at https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf
